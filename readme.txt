# Monty Hall paradox - 22/4/2019
# problem statement : We have 3 doors : behind 2 doors, there is a goat and behind one door there is car
# 1 - The player choose one door
# 2 - The presenter knows where the car is. He opens a door whith a goat behind
# 3 - The presenter offers the player to change his choice

# To garantee a correct result, program iterates one million
# at each iteration, we count if the good choice is the first door or the other door
# and we can check the results as a percentage : Should the player change his mind or not ?
